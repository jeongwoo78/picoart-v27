   - Animals (tiger, bird, fish, horse) → Select artwork with matching animal
   - Flowers/plants → Select artwork with matching flowers/plants
   - Landscape/mountains/nature → Select landscape or mountain artwork
   - Bright/colorful photo → Prefer "folk painting" style (vivid colors)
   - Group of people → Select artwork with "festival" or "people" in subjects

2. STYLE MATCHING:
   - Elegant/refined photo → beauty portrait, elegant style
   - Bright/cheerful/colorful → folk painting (Minhwa)
   - Nature/simple → ink wash painting
   - Dynamic/action → genre painting with movement

3. COLOR MATCHING:
   - Colorful vibrant photo → artworks with "bright colors", "vibrant colors", "folk painting"
   - Monochrome/subtle photo → artworks with "black ink", "ink wash"

CRITICAL: Pay special attention to whether the photo shows a PERSON (especially women) or ANIMALS or NATURE.
Match the PRIMARY subject first, then consider mood and colors.
